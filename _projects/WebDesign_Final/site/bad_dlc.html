		<p>Now the whole point of DLC is to sustain the ‘life’ of a game, especially for multiplayer games, because new content for the player gives them another reason to play that particular game. However, the first concept of DLC to charge players for extra content such as maps or weapons like in Call of Duty seemed like a good idea at first, but as the general gaming market has evolved over the years, consumers expect more and more out of their games and being asked to purchase new content feels like a rip off at times. In some instances, it’s as if the developers are trying to milk the consumer, especially when a major company releases a similar game a year or two later with little differentiating the two games when referring to the overall mechanics behind the game. Thankfully for 343 Studios, the dev’s behind Halo 5, they noticed this changed and have shifted their DLC to a more cosmetic approach to give those players an option to support the game without impacting the player base by splitting the community between maps or milking the consumer since the extra content isn’t necessary to purchase if you want to play with your friends on those new maps.</p>
		<p>However, games mobile games like ‘Clash of Clans’ are possibly one of the worst types of games from a consumer standpoint due to the DLC that has been known as micro-transactions due to the pure amount of them and the usual price being cheaper than usual DLC (however you can still buy $99 worth in one purchase). This is due to the currency in-game that you can purchase with real cash which will essentially boost the progression of your base. You technically don’t have to buy it, but if you don’t you have to play the game for about 2 years in order to fully max out your base. Combine that with the wait times to attack, and it’s no wonder why people have laid several hundreds of dollars in the game. In a way it is majorly successful, because it can be very addicting to play and has been able to hook over 100 million players on the android market alone, however that doesn’t excuse the fact that it’s DLC is one of the worst out there.</p>
