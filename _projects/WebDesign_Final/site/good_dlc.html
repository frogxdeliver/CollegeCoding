		<p>From both a competitive and consumer standpoint, two popular games that nailed the method of DLC would be Rocket League and Counter Strike Global Offensive. Both have the same idea, to add updates to the game that fix bugs, add maps, and balance or tweak the game to the game to keep it popular. Then alongside that they have cosmetic DLC for your cars in Rocket League or weapon skins in CSGO, both add nothing fundamentally different to the overall experience from a competitive standpoint, however they add a bit more variety to the game and don’t make it seem like you need to buy it. In return the only people that buy extra content are usually the ones who truly love the game which is how it should be. This system keeps the overall experience of the game in tact without separating it or hindering the overall gameplay with small DLC bits seen in other games. It’s especially rampant in mobile games, and it’s rather sad how many devs practice this form of DLC as an easy cash-grab approach instead of trying to preserve their game long-term. </p>
