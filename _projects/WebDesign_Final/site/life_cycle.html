		<p>For many games, they will be played for a certain amount of time while they remain relevant in popularity until another game replaces it in some way or form. This could be due to time itself due to the graphics behind a game, the community playing the game decreasing overtime due to loss of interest, or many other reasons. In order to combat this (and keep the price of game’s low at first) developers have provided DLC to sustain the life cycle of a game especially a multiplayer focused game where if you don’t help the community playing the game, then nobody will continue to play your game. The only exception to this would be Super Smash Bros Melee which was released in 2001, and yet still has a competitive scene backing it with no feedback whatsoever from the developers in Japan which is rather sad to see really. Besides melee, there really isn’t another game that is still popular without DLC.</p>
