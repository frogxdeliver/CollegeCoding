		<p>For starters, DLC in gaming terminology refers to the Downloadable Content that is created after the initial release of a particular game in order to support its developers and keep the game alive in a sense. Probably the most popular initial use of DLC would be the addition of maps and guns to a game like Call of Duty, which has been doing the same basic concept of DLC since Modern Warfare 2 in 2009. </p>

		<p>However, the developers behind Halo have sort of changed their formula for DLC release since Halo 3 which initially released in 2007. Now with the launch of Halo 5 in 2015, the focus has shifted from maps and guns to cosmetic items, and have gone a new popular route of free maps and guns in later updates. This has been proven to work quite well, as I will show on the Good DLC page, and it’s interesting to see developers shift their focus after doing the same strategy for years.</p>
